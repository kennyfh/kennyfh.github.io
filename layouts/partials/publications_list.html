            <div id="abstract0" class="abstract-block" style="display:none;">This study focuses on estimating the lead times of various processes in wind tower factories. Accurate estimation of these times allows for more efficient sequencing of activities, proper allocation of resources, and setting of realistic delivery dates, thus avoiding delays and bottlenecks in the production flow and improving process quality and efficiency. In addition, accurate estimation of these times contributes to a proper assessment of costs, overcoming the limitations of traditional techniques; this allows for the establishment of tighter quotations. The data used in this study were collected at wind tower manufacturing facilities in Spain and Brazil. Data preprocessing was conducted rigorously, encompassing cleaning, transformation, and feature selection processes. Following preprocessing, machine learning regression analysis was performed to estimate lead times. Nine algorithms were employed: decision trees, random forest, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Elastic Net, support vector regression, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and multilayer perceptron. Additionally, the performance of two deep learning models, TabNet and NODE, designed specifically for tabular data, was evaluated. The results showed that gradient boosting-based algorithms were the most effective in predicting processing times and optimizing resource allocation. The system is designed to retrain models as new information becomes available.</div>
