ABSTRACT = {This study focuses on estimating the lead times of various processes in wind tower factories. Accurate estimation of these times allows for more efficient sequencing of activities, proper allocation of resources, and setting of realistic delivery dates, thus avoiding delays and bottlenecks in the production flow and improving process quality and efficiency. In addition, accurate estimation of these times contributes to a proper assessment of costs, overcoming the limitations of traditional techniques; this allows for the establishment of tighter quotations. The data used in this study were collected at wind tower manufacturing facilities in Spain and Brazil. Data preprocessing was conducted rigorously, encompassing cleaning, transformation, and feature selection processes. Following preprocessing, machine learning regression analysis was performed to estimate lead times. Nine algorithms were employed: decision trees, random forest, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Elastic Net, support vector regression, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and multilayer perceptron. Additionally, the performance of two deep learning models, TabNet and NODE, designed specifically for tabular data, was evaluated. The results showed that gradient boosting-based algorithms were the most effective in predicting processing times and optimizing resource allocation. The system is designed to retrain models as new information becomes available.},

abstract="This study focuses on the exploration and application of machine learning techniques to predict the process time of operations with high variability. The proposed methodology includes the identification of significant parameters, the individual prediction of every operation and the integration of individual prediction to determine the lead time of the chain. The study is conducted in wind tower manufacturing plants located in Spain and Brazil. The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of other current techniques such as direct formulation or linear programming. The results indicate that, overall, gradient boosting models, such as XGBoost or LightGBM, achieve better performance in a significant portion of the operations, although other models like NODE also demonstrate superior results in certain specific operations.",

abstract = {Accurate lead time prediction is critical for optimising sequential manufacturing processes, particularly in industries with high variability such as wind turbine tower production. This paper proposes a machine learning-based system to estimate lead times for two pivotal sequential operations: bending and longitudinal welding (LW). A distinctive feature of this system is its innovative integration strategy, where the predictive output from the bending model, specifically, the predicted bending lead time and its associated error, is leveraged as an input feature for the LW lead time estimation model. This approach explicitly models and enhances the representation of inter-process dependencies. While bending predictions show moderate performance, their inclusion as inputs demonstrably and significantly improves LW lead time estimation accuracy. A key contribution of this work is the comparative analysis between the ML-based LW predictions and traditional engineering methods. Our results demonstrate that the integrated ML model for LW achieves a 54% reduction in MAE (from 11.36 to 2.03 h) and a 74% lower RMSE (from 12.01 to 3.13 h) compared to engineering estimates, validating its superior accuracy. To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) identifies critical factors such as sheet thickness, personnel experience, and upstream process quality, including the impact of the integrated bending predictions. The system’s low execution time enables real-time scheduling adjustments, offering a practical solution for production planning. These findings highlight the transformative potential of ML, particularly through such sequential predictive integration, in replacing outdated engineering heuristics and providing actionable insights for complex manufacturing environments.}
