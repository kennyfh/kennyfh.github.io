I'm Kenny, a first-year PhD student at the University of Seville under the guidance of Prof. Alejandro Escudero. My research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence in industrial settings, particularly exploring how AI can enhance production efficiency and decision-making in complex environments. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Logic, Computing, and Artificial Intelligence from the University of Seville, where I developed a strong foundation in AI, data science, and various programming paradigms.

Currently, I work as a specialist technician in the Department of Industrial Organization and Management of Companies II at the University of Seville. My role involves applying machine learning techniques to optimize Production Planning and Control within the metallurgical industry, blending academic research with practical industry challenges. I have a proven track record of implementing machine learning models using Python, leveraging tools such as Scikit-Learn, NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, and Gradio.

In addition to my expertise in machine learning, I have explored functional programming with Haskell, focusing on the development of parallel algorithms for GPU computing. I am passionate about the transformative power of AI in industrial applications and am constantly seeking new opportunities to drive innovation and solve complex problems.
